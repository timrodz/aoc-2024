# Advent Of Code 2024

Solutions for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024/), with Elixir! It's a really cool language I'm learningâ€”You should try it out!

## Usage

Run solutions with `mix run lib/day_<number>/runner.exs`:

```shell
mix run lib/day_1/runner.exs
```

Note: Every solution directory must have an `input.txt` file with the input for the challenge - It's been added to the .gitignore file so it's not accidentally committed.
